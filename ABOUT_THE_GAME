In this Project we will be seeing how we can teach a Ball âš½ to Accuratelly Hit The Target Target ðŸŽ¯ Which are Randomly appering on the screen by learning through Observations .

We are using LinearRegression for this Project.

Here we just have to predict one variable that is the initial speed(U) of the Ball âš½ based on the given input of theta (Angle) by the User.

The Basic idea is that first we will be traning the model by providing it with

the correct answer for U.

The Data to be feed to the model or the Feactures are X_DISTANCE and Y_DISTANCE of the Target and the theta (ANGLE).
